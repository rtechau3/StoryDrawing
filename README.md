# StoryDrawing
A unique tool that lets you draw your stories. This tool is programmed in the visual arts language Processing.

The program works by taking input from the keyboard and then drawing shapes representative of that input. Shapes, which represent letters, numbers, or punctuation, appear at random points within a small cluster, which represents a word, until the user presses ENTER and moves to a different part of the screen (i.e. a new word is formed).

Uppercase letters draw large circles, lowercase letters draw small circles. numbers draw squares, and punctuation draws triangles. The RGB values of the shapes are set randomly based on 255 divided by the number of nonvowel keys in that line of keys. Vowels have lighter colors given their importance in forming words. Periods are blue to symbolize resolution (as they mark the end of a thought), and exclamation marks are bright pink to catch attention.

The full scope of input includes all capital and lowercase letters, numbers 0-9, commas, periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. To begin a new story, the user can press DELETE to reset the screen.

Happy storytelling!
